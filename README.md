# EaglerCraft (In beta)
EaglerCraft is currently in its testing phase. To use it currently, go to https://ringthebell02.github.io/user-unblocked/thecraft_test

It appears as if multiplayer sharing is not working at the moment, however since I do not host the servers, I don't know what is happening.
I did not make EaglerCraft; I expect all users of it have a paid minecraft license.
# Movies/TV
I was not the person to find the links to the films. I pay for all streaming services that these movies and shows are on, so I am not pirating anything.
# Games
These games were found on various websites. I am simply creating a list of them.
# AI
The only "decent" AI that I have found that is unblocked (at least on my school's network) is Microsoft CoPilot. I keep forgeting to change the link from ChatGPT to Copilot. Again, suggestions are appreciated.
